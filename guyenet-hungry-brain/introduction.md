# Introduction

- The nonconcious part of our brain, which strives for immediate gratification, is **in conflict** with the conscious part of our brian, which cares about long-term goals such as health and body weight.
- **Dietary guidelines** *"target the wrong brain circuits."*
- The impulses that pose a problem today were **essential to our ancestors.** This is called an *evolutionary mismatch.*
- The author thinks that *"the only way to truly understand overeating and obesity is to understand the brain."*
- There are multiple **brain systems** which have an influence on eating behavior. The book seeks to cover the most important ones.
