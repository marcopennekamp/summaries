# Chapter 10 – Type Systems

- Type systems are a **syntactic framework** that classify expressions based on the **type** of values they compute. They check whether such expression types conform to **typing rules.**
- This chapter only covers **static type checks.**



## 10.1 – Type Systems Basics

- Type systems should declare **fixed types.** These types are constant and known in advance. For example, integer constants have fixed types.
- Type systems should provide means with which types can be **derived** from the type of other elements.
- A **type hierarchy** should be supported by the type system.
- The type system must be able to perform **type checks** and report errors.
- In the language workbenches discussed in the book, types are **represented by language concepts.**
